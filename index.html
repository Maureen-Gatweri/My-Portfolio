                <h3>Project 1: [Reverse-taka]</h3>
                <p>I recently collaborated with my team members to work on a project where we developed a system that enables
                     informal artisans to source non-recyclable clothes as raw materials for their business. The platform includes an online shop where recycled clothes are available. It also includes a reward system 
                      where shoppers earn points as they shop. I also built a dashboard that allows us to monitor 
                      each spending of a user, points earned, and app activity.
